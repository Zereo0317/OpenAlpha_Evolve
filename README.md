# OpenAlpha_Evolve: Contribute to Improve this Project

![openalpha_evolve_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4709ad-0072-44ae-bbb5-7eea1c5fa08c)

OpenAlpha_Evolve is an open-source Python framework inspired by the groundbreaking research on autonomous coding agents like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It's a **regeneration** of the core idea: an intelligent system that iteratively writes, tests, and improves code using Large Language Models (LLMs) via LiteLLM, guided by the principles of evolution.

Our mission is to provide an accessible, understandable, and extensible platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the fascinating intersection of AI, code generation, and automated problem-solving.

## ✨ The Vision: AI-Driven Algorithmic Innovation

Imagine an agent that can:

*   Understand a complex problem description.
*   Generate initial algorithmic solutions.
*   Rigorously test its own code.
*   Learn from failures and successes.
*   Evolve increasingly sophisticated and efficient algorithms over time.

OpenAlpha_Evolve is a step towards this vision. It's not just about generating code; it's about creating a system that *discovers* and *refines* solutions autonomously.

## 🧠 How It Works: The Evolutionary Cycle

OpenAlpha_Evolve employs a modular, agent-based architecture to orchestrate an evolutionary process:

1.  **Task Definition**: You, the user, define the algorithmic "quest" – the problem to be solved, including examples of inputs and expected outputs.
2.  **Prompt Engineering (`PromptDesignerAgent`)**: This agent crafts intelligent prompts for the LLM. It designs:
    *   *Initial Prompts*: To generate the first set of candidate solutions.
    *   *Mutation Prompts*: To introduce variations and improvements to existing solutions, often requesting changes in a "diff" format.
    *   *Bug-Fix Prompts*: To guide the LLM in correcting errors from previous attempts, also typically expecting a "diff".
3.  **Code Generation (`CodeGeneratorAgent`)**: Powered by an LLM (currently configured for Gemini), this agent takes the prompts and generates Python code. If a "diff" is requested and received, it attempts to apply the changes to the parent code.
4.  **Evaluation (`EvaluatorAgent`)**: The generated code is put to the test!
    *   *Syntax Check*: Is the code valid Python?
    *   *Execution*: The code is run in a temporary, isolated environment against the input/output examples defined in the task.
    *   *Fitness Scoring*: Programs are scored based on correctness (how many test cases pass), efficiency (runtime), and other potential metrics.
5.  **Database (`DatabaseAgent`)**: All programs (code, fitness scores, generation, lineage) are stored, creating a record of the evolutionary history (currently in-memory).
6.  **Selection (`SelectionControllerAgent`)**: The "survival of the fittest" principle in action. This agent selects:
    *   *Parents*: Promising programs from the current generation to produce offspring.
    *   *Survivors*: The best programs from both the current population and new offspring to advance to the next generation.
7.  **Iteration**: This cycle repeats for a defined number of generations, with each new generation aiming to produce better solutions than the last.
8.  **Orchestration (`TaskManagerAgent`)**: The maestro of the operation, coordinating all other agents and managing the overall evolutionary loop.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   `pip` for package management
    *   `git` for cloning
    *   **Docker**: For sandboxed code evaluation. Ensure Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux) is installed and running. Visit [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAlpha_Evolve.git
    cd OpenAlpha_Evolve
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Crucial for API Keys)**:
    *   **This step is essential for the application to function correctly with your API keys.** The `.env` file stores your sensitive credentials and configuration, overriding the default placeholders in `config/settings.py`.
    *   Create your personal environment file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env_example .env
        ```


### LLM Configuration



8.  **Run OpenAlpha_Evolve!**
    The `main.py` file is configured with an example task (Dijkstra's algorithm). To run it:
    ```bash
    python -m main
    ```
    Watch the logs in your terminal to see the evolutionary process unfold! Log files are also saved to `alpha_evolve.log` (by default).

8.  **Launch the Gradio Web Interface**
    Interact with the system via the web UI. To start the Gradio app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Gradio will display a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) and a public share link if enabled. Open this in your browser to define custom tasks and run the evolution process interactively.

## 💡 Defining Your Own Algorithmic Quests!

Want to challenge OpenAlpha_Evolve with a new problem? It's easy:

1.  **Open `main.py`** (or your custom script where you define tasks).
2.  **Modify or create a `TaskDefinition` object**:
    *   `id`: A unique string identifier for your task (e.g., "sort_list_task", "find_max_with_bound_task").
    *   `description`: A clear, detailed natural language description of the problem. This is crucial for the LLM to understand what to do. Be specific about function names, expected behavior, and constraints.
    *   `function_name_to_evolve`: The name of the Python function the agent should try to create/evolve (e.g., "custom_sort", "find_max_above_threshold").
    *   `input_output_examples`: A list of dictionaries, each containing an `input` and the corresponding expected `output`. These are vital for evaluation.
        *   The `input` field for each example should be a list, where each element of the list corresponds to an argument for your function. If your function takes a single argument, this will be a list containing that one argument. For functions with multiple arguments, the list will contain all arguments in the correct order (e.g., `input=[[1, 2, 3], 0]` for a function `my_func(list_arg, threshold_arg)`).
        *   For numerical problems requiring positive or negative infinity, you can use `float('inf')` or `float('-inf')` directly in your Python code when defining these examples. The system's evaluation harness is designed to correctly serialize and deserialize these special float values. See the example below.
    *   `allowed_imports`: Specify a list of Python standard libraries that the generated code is allowed to import (e.g., `["heapq", "math", "sys"]`). This helps guide the LLM and can be important for the execution sandbox.
    *   (Optional) `evaluation_criteria`: Define how success is measured (currently primarily driven by correctness based on test cases).
    *   (Optional) `initial_code_prompt`: Override the default initial prompt if you need more specific instructions for the first code generation attempt.

3.  **Run the agent** with your new or modified task definition.

The quality of your `description` and the comprehensiveness of your `input_output_examples` significantly impact the agent's success!

### Example: TaskDefinition with `float('inf')`

Here's a conceptual example of how you might define a task that requires the use of `float('-inf')` as an initial comparison point for finding a maximum value within a certain range.

```python
from core.task_definition import TaskDefinition

find_max_task = TaskDefinition(
    id="find_max_in_list_with_lower_bound",
    description="Write a Python function called 'find_max_with_bound' that takes a list of numbers and a lower bound. "
                "The function should return the largest number in the list that is greater than or equal to the lower bound. "
                "If no such number exists, it should return float('-inf').",
    function_name_to_evolve="find_max_with_bound",
    input_output_examples=[
        {"input": [[1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 10], 3], "output": 10},
        {"input": [[-1, -5, -2, -8], 0], "output": float('-inf')},
        {"input": [[10, 20, 30], 10], "output": 30},
        {"input": [[5, 15, 25], 30], "output": float('-inf')},
        {"input": [[4, 8, 2], float('-inf')], "output": 8}, # Using -inf as a bound
        {"input": [[], 5], "output": float('-inf')}, # Empty list case
    ],
    allowed_imports=["math"] # Allow 'math' if needed, though float('-inf') is built-in
)

# To use this task, you would pass `find_max_task` to the TaskManagerAgent.
# Note: float('inf') and float('-inf') are used directly in the Python list.
# The system will handle their JSON serialization/deserialization during evaluation.
```

### Best Practices for Task Definition

Crafting effective task definitions is key to guiding OpenAlpha_Evolve successfully. Consider these tips:

*   **Be Clear and Unambiguous**: Write task descriptions as if you're explaining the problem to another developer. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly. The more precise your language, the better the LLM can interpret your intent.
*   **Provide Diverse and Comprehensive Examples**: Your `input_output_examples` are the primary way the agent verifies its generated code.
    *   Include typical use cases.
    *   Cover edge cases (e.g., empty lists, zero values, very large or small numbers, `None` inputs if applicable).
    *   Include examples that test different logical paths in the expected solution.
    *   Ensure the outputs are correct for each input.
*   **Start Simple, Then Increase Complexity**: If you have a complex problem, consider breaking it down or starting with a simpler version. Once the agent can solve the simpler task, you can gradually add more constraints or features to the description and examples. This iterative approach can be more effective than starting with a highly complex definition.
*   **Specify Constraints and Edge Cases in the Description**: Don't rely solely on examples to convey all requirements. If there are specific constraints (e.g., "the input list will always contain positive integers," "the function should handle lists up to 10,000 elements efficiently") or known edge cases that need special handling, mention them explicitly in the `description`.
*   **Define Expected Function Signature**: Clearly state the expected function name (`function_name_to_evolve`) and the nature of its parameters in the `description`. This helps the LLM generate code that matches your evaluation setup.
*   **Iterate and Refine**: Your first task definition might not be perfect. If the agent struggles or produces incorrect solutions, review your description and examples. Are they clear? Are there any ambiguities? Could more examples help? Iteratively refine your task definition based on the agent's performance.
